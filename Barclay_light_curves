Description of light curve data
-------------------------------
There's a webpage describing the instrument:

https://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/everett/nessi/

The wide field mode and camera setup for light curves has been
less explored than what's used for speckle operations.  The readouts
I used for both light curves were done using a conventional
amplifier, making the cameras operate like conventional CCDs rather 
than EMCCDs, but with an electronic frame transfer shutter.  The 
amplifier is relatively low readnoise with (I think) pretty well 
behaved biases and 1-second readout times.  With the frame 
transfer shutter, there's almost no overhead time because exposures
and readouts happen simultaneously.

The wide field mode has fast optics and obvious vignetting.  I took
dome flats in griz and some sky flats in u.  I hope they will flatten
images well.

The plate scale should be near 0.08 arcsec/pixel.  It probably varies
a fair bit across the field.

I made some photon transfer curves (apr10 data) which show the cameras 
to be linear in response up to ~55000 ADUs.  Some of the data consist 
of co-added exposures (coadding is post-readout) and only the counts in 
an individual exposure needed to be below that threshold.  Some of the
data can range into the 100s of thousands of ADUs and are saved at 32
bits/pixel in those cases.

My measurements for the cameras were:

Blue camera mean bias level = 502 ADUs
Blue camera gain = 0.82 e/ADU.
Blue camera readnoise = 5.9 ADUs = 4.8e
Blue camera linear up to 57000 ADUs above bias

Red camera mean bias level = 502 ADUs
Red camera gain = 0.78 e/ADU.
Red camera readnoise = 5.8 ADUs = 4.5e
Red camera linear up to 55000 ADUs above bias

FITS file names begin nb* or nr* referring to a blue or red channel 
camera respectively.  They contain a timestamp of file creation 
(HH.MM.SS in UT) and a consecutive file number.  All images are full 
array and unbinned, so 1024x1024 pixels and most are 3-D fits files that
come from what Andor calls "kinetic series", or simply a sequence
in time where the 3rd dimension is a frame number.  The FITS files are 
either 16 bit integers or 32 bits/pixel.

The computer time was been set to UT to within ~1second according to
inspection of the observatory clock at the beginning of the night.  
The FITS headers contain that computer time in the FRAME keyword, 
which is only recorded to the nearest second.  A very accurate relative 
time can be found between the starting times of any two adjacent frames 
in the series using the KCT keyword.  In order to inspect the data as 
the night goes along, I used a finite series length (e.g. 10 or 20 
frames) where, at the end of each series, the file gets written.  The 
number of frames in each the series is written to the NUMKIN keyword.

In most cases, each frame in the kinetic series consists of a coadded 
sum of a small set of shorter exposures.  The exposure time is found 
in the EXPOSURE keyword.  The time between the start of one exposure and
the next within the group of coadded exposures (what Andor calls
accumulation) is given by the ACT keyword.  The number of accumulations
in each frame is given by the NUMACC keyword.

The two cameras are not completely in sync due to the script behavior.  
To my eye, it appeared that the exposures in the red camera lagged behind 
the blue by a few tenths of a second.

Given writing and actions of the script that I use to start the next 
series there's a lag of some several seconds between the time the last 
data is exposed in one series and the start of data-taking in the next.

calibration notes:
------------------
Afternoon dome flat calibration data put in calibrations/ subdirectory.
* Wide field mode, conventional amplifier, frame transfer mode, 4.33musec vshift speed,
 normal vertical clocking voltage amplitude, 1MHz readout rate, Gain setting 2.
* lamps started at 1000.

image #		UT	  what
-------		-----	  ----------
1		22:54	  1.105sec "biases" with shutters closed, kinetic series of 12.
                          (timestamp on these images was daylight savings...then I
                          changed it for the rest!)
2		23:11	  u/z flats 1.105 sec each; u is massively underexposed.
			      Must use sky for u!
3	        23:15	  g/i flats 40sec/1.105 sec. Series of 12
4		23:24     r/i flats 5sec/1.105sec.  Series of 12

* at this point lamps are turned up to 1300...

5-28	     23:29-23:43  r/716nm flats at different exposure times starting at 1.105sec, 
                          ramping up to saturation (for a photon transfer curve).  Each
                          file is a kinetic series of 2.	  
I noted 2 donuts in the red camera flats centered at (col,row)=(583,423) and (680,511)

light curve notes:
------------------
Transit observation of HAT-P-26  
  g+i filters
  Wide field optics (reset focus -120 vs. speckle focus).  
  Full 1024x1024 frames, unbinned.
  Conventional amplifier
  Frame transfer mode 
  1MHz readout rate
  4.33musec vertical shift speed 
  Gain setting="2" 
  Vertical clocking voltage amplitude="normal".
  EMCCD Cooling to -60C.

  Operating with the i-band essentially at focus.  The g-band is out-of-focus
  due to the non-flatness of the dichroic.  However, with the seeing conditions
  (which aren't good), the g-band stellar profiles look more round than the
  better seeing astigmatic/donut shape profiles native to this configuration.
  Note that a reflection, of perhaps HAT-P-26, appears in the red camera.  The
  red camera also has quite strong variation in background level that I suspect
  is reflected moonlight.  It changed over the course of the transit.

  Starting out some test exposures.  I wanted to see the exposure level in a
  single frame, set exposure time to safely fit in a 55000 ADU linearity
  limit, and check exposure level in an accumulated (coadded) image to see
  that it made logical sense.

   This exposure with 1 accumulation and kinetic series length 1 and 1.105 sec exptime:
H720001 1928 05:42    0    0 14:12:37.5 +04:03:36 2000.00  11.8   BARCLAY/HAT-P-26

   This exposure with 20 accumulations and kinetic series length 1 and 3 sec exposures,
   but accidentally saved as a 16-bit integer FITS file:
H720001 1930 05:47    0    0 14:12:37.5 +04:03:36 2000.00  11.8   BARCLAY/HAT-P-26
   This exposure with 20 accumulations and kinetic series length 1 and 3 sec exposures,
   and saving now with 32 bits/pixel (BITPIX=32):

  Now the real light curve.  Have switched to a longer kinetic series (for 10 minutes 
  between mouse clicks).  The time sampling is 60.09 seconds within each series and
  uses 20 coadded 3-second exposures to get there. 
   
  Starting out with an airmass a bit > 1.3.  The sky appears to be clear 
  at the moment.  Light clouds might be on the way.

   07:27 moved +30 in focus.  Had seen wider FWHM, thought it was temperature drop
         requiring an increase in telescope focus value.

                  These are taken a few seconds apart.


Light curve notes:
------------------
The sky looks clear!

Wide field optics, full frame images, unbinned, conventional amplifier,
frame transfer mode, 1MHz, 4.33microsecond vshift speed, Gain setting=2,
normal vertical clocking voltage amplitude.

Arranged the target and the only somewhat comparable comparison star on
opposite sides of the CCD.  The stars don't appear to be too close to
the edges, but that's to be determined.  Vignetting pattern is roughly symmetrical 
about the center of the images and rotation of the instrument could have been 
done, apparently, but the stars would be at comparable points relative to 
this pattern.

Defocussed telescope relative to speckle focus by -370 in order to (at least
roughly) get defocus similar in both cameras.  It appears that the 
shapes of the donuts are rather different on a given camera (TrES-4 vs. its 
comparison star).

Using u+z filters first for some test data before switching over to g+i...

Tested exposure times.  Trying for 1-minute sampling.
Chose 60 second exposures in u, 6x10 second exposures in z.  u is very faint
  while peak counts in z is ~10000 ADUs.
u camera: 60s exptime, 1 accumulation, kinetic series length=10
z camera: 10s exptime, 6 accumulations, kinetic series length=10

Airmass was ~2.0 to start

  for this next exposure, shortened the kinetic series to length=5 to move
  on with the other filters earlier:

  Switched now to g+i filters...
  Chose 15 second exposures in each filter with coadds of 4 exposures each for
  time sampling of 60 seconds.  Peak counts are ~10000 ADUs in both filters.

  first image set consists of a kinetic series of 10:

  now changed kinetic series length to 20 for convenience and changed file format 
  from 16-bits to 32 bits to stay safe...

Note: this light curve finishes up with a zenith distance of 5 degrees.  That 
worked well enough.  Had it been much closer, the telescope couldn't have tracked 
very well. I'm not sure exactly where the cutoff would be.  I can ask.
